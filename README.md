# SADA Challenge

Thank you SADA for providing me this opportunity.

I have selected and solved Highest_Profit Challange.

# Python:

Part 1
First i have used Pandas Library then i have imported raw data file directly from github and stored in a dataframe variable. After that i have used print function to output the number of rows.
Created a function where it only filters rows having numeric values on 'Profit (in millions)' column

Part 2
In this part i have created a file called data2.json which contains output by Profit (in millions) in descending order for numeric only rows.
Printed top 20 rows with the highest profit.

Part 3
data2.json file is generated.

# SQL:

Created a table 'sada_test' within schema 'world'. 

Used MySQL Import Wizard functionality to import data into the table.

Consumed REGEXP (Regular Expressions) to get the rows with Numeric only.
